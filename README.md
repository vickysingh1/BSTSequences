# BSTSequences
- Given a binary search tree (input), find out all the possible sequences (output), which when used to create a BST, would result in the same binary search tree as the input. 
- Assume the BST only take integers for nodes and not balanced. 
- Input would be space separated intergers that could be used to construct the BST  
Example 
input:
2 1 3  
Output: 
2 1 3 2 3 1
